# GoalieGuard AI Protocol: Defining & Measuring Success

## 1. Core Philosophy verification
**"The goal is not to clone a legend, but to optimize the individual."**

While we use data from greats like **Tom Brady** (mental resilience, longevity) and **Wayne Gretzky** (vision, anticipation) as *benchmarks for excellence*, the AI's primary directive is **Self-Referential Growth**.

### The "Why":
Logic alone cannot capture the nuance of a goalie's psyche. A goalie might have a 95% save percentage but feel terrible because they let in a soft goal in the final minute. Conversely, they might lose 5-4 but feel amazing because they made 50 saves and kept the team in it. **Success is the alignment of Performance and Perception.**

## 2. The Success Metric (The "Goalie Score")
We don't just look at "Wins". We measure success through a composite score:

### A. Operational Metrics (Data)
*   **Save Percentage (SV%)**: quantitative baseline.
*   **High Danger Save %**: Performance under pressure.
*   **Rebound Control**: Technical efficiency.

### B. Psycho-Emotional Metrics (The Human Element)
*   **Confidence Index**: Derived from "Baseline Check-ins" and Journal entries.
*   **Resilience Score**: How quickly does mood rebound after a "Frustrated" entry?
*   **Consistency**: Variance in mood and performance over time.

## 3. The AI Decision Tree (How it "Thinks")

When a goalie inputs data (e.g., "I felt slow today"), the AI follows this hierarchy:

1.  **Check Internal Baseline (Self-Correction):**
    *   *Question:* "Is this normal for Elliott?"
    *   *Action:* If Elliott usually feels slow on Tuesdays after heavy leg workouts, the advice is "Rest & Recovery." If this is new, the advice is "Technical Drill."

2.  **Contextual Peer Comparison (Reality Check):**
    *   *Question:* "Is this a systemic issue for his level (U18, AAA)?"
    *   *Action:* "At the U18 level, speed creates gaps. Let's focus on *positioning* (Depth) so you don't *have* to be as fast."

3.  **Archetypal Inspiration (The "Brady/Gretzky" Factor):**
    *   *Question:* "What mental model solves this?"
    *   *Action:* "Think of Brady in the 4th quarter. He doesn't sprint; he slows the game down. Don't chase the puck; let it come to you."

## 4. Testing The Protocol (Stress Test)
To properly stress test the AI, we need to feed it **Polarized Inputs**:

### Scenario A: The "False Failure"
*   **Input:** "We won 4-0, but I felt lost and lucky."
*   **AI Expectation:** Should NOT praise the shutout. Should dig into *Imposter Syndrome* and focus on *Process over Result*.

### Scenario B: The "Good Loss"
*   **Input:** "We lost 2-1 in OT. I made 45 saves. I feel crushed."
*   **AI Expectation:** Should VALIDATE the pain but HIGHLIGHT the performance. "You gave your team a chance. That is the job. Build on this."

## 5. Conclusion
We don't "take them" to be Gretzky. We take them to be **Consistent, Resilient, and Self-Aware**. When those three traits peak, the "Stats" take care of themselves.
